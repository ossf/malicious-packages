  "details": "When the user uses the provided library, this package silently reports basic information and the result of the user's action to a hardcoded, obfuscated URL. Given the lack of an opt-out possibility, collection of usernames, obfuscated target and not disclosing it anywhere, it cannot be classified as telemetry.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\n\n\nCampaign: 2026-02-flycord\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - obfuscation\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - action-hidden-in-lib-usage\n\n",
