It has a limited risk.\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (130b3663b76a97ade6e8b4ac7fd68832b2d953067f5c9f251198e5eca48461e2)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'hello-wordl' @ 0.2.0 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n",
