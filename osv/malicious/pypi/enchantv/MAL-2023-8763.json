It has a limited risk.\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n - Downloads and executes a remote malicious script.\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (cd0a61ade3d3a9bb9b83668fad7ee8a45f0bfe95bc9cc98270bcd15b615d875e)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'enchantv' @ 1.0.0 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n\n- The package executes one or more commands associated with malicious behavior.\n",
