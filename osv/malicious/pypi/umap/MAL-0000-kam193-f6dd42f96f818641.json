  "summary": "Pentesting or research code in umap (PyPI)",
  "details": "Simple dependency confusion test. Versions before 0.1.2 do not perform any active action.\n\nThe original umap package existed in the past, but was removed by the author. The last version was 0.1.1 published as a source package. Years later, the same name was registered by another user, who managed to publish a wheel package of version 0.1.1 as it's not prohibited to upload alternative build packages for existing versions. This hijacked version was an empty package. In 0.1.2, a beacon webhook was added. \n\nMore context: https://github.com/kam193/package-campaigns/issues/5\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research \u0026 co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: GENERIC-standard-pypi-install-pentest\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n\n",
