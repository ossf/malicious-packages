It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (0a92fb7d81045a82240752c9122482082867f85a64640d5d56fd4f9a685f1425)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'displaydoc' @ 1.0.0 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n\n- The package executes one or more commands associated with malicious behavior.\n",
