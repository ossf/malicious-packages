It has a limited risk.\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n - Downloads and executes a remote malicious script.\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (9aa03155d8305b625aecdc1871776dc46f0c76e1fefd1a86c14b0198272f16a3)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'excaliburx' @ 1.0.0 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n\n- The package executes one or more commands associated with malicious behavior.\n",
