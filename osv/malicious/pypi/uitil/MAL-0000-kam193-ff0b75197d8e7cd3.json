  "summary": "Malicious code in uitil (PyPI)",
  "details": "The package implements an undocumented way to execute code hidden in image files, and a function that searches for images in the current directory and attempts to execute the code. \n\nIt's used in the GitHub repository https://github.com/OR-6/PassCheck/blob/main/main.py#L190 to silently execute the command hidden in the image https://github.com/OR-6/PassCheck/blob/b09b3f1ec5d7345c614b1d956840ee2774f7131b/demo.png  when the user interacts with the repository code. The decrypted command attempted to download and execute code from hxxps://or-6.github[.]io, which at the time of analysis didn't host any code.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\n\n\nCampaign: 2026-01-uitil\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - steganography\n\n\n - The malicious code is intentionally included in a dependency of the package\n\n\n - action-hidden-in-lib-usage\n\n\n - The package contains code to execute remote commands (probably limited to a specific set) on the victim's machine.\n\n",
