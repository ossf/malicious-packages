The new \"requests/__init__.py\" takes over common requests features and uses the implementation that a) logs every request to a file (but no external exfiltration, this may also be expected in some situations); b) after every 5 requests, opens the calculator app. The second shows clearly that the intention is to present a security risk, not create a real package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research \u0026 co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2025-08-netmanagement\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - action-hidden-in-lib-usage\n\n\n - other\n\n",
