It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (01c9a259f7b88e992aee84db09b728b15f74a517857ab5b3aaa16f725a9debbd)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'crc32fast' @ 1.0.99 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n\n- The package executes one or more commands associated with malicious behavior.\n",
