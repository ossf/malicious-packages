  "details": "This package is considered malicious because it contains a heavily obfuscated postinstall.js script with multiple stages of payload execution, resulting in the delivery of QuasarRAT. This allows command and control by a malicious actor.\n\n---\n_-= Per source details.

All secrets and keys stored on that computer should be rotated immediately from a different computer. The package should be removed, but as full control of the computer may have been given to an outside entity, there is no guarantee that removing the package will remove all malicious software resulting from installing it.\n",
