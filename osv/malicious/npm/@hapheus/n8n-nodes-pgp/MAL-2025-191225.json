All secrets and keys stored on that computer should be rotated immediately from a different computer. The package should be removed, but as full control of the computer may have been given to an outside entity, there is no guarantee that removing the package will remove all malicious software resulting from installing it.\n\n## Source: google-open-source-security (debe04767edaf9ab6fa487da5f157cf2ec2d60089c743ba64d36865b4798b6da)\nThis package was compromised by the Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming NPM worm.\nThe malicious payload steals tokens and credentials and publishes them to\nGitHub. The worm will propogate itself to NPM packages the user owns and\nestablish persistence is a GitHub action.\nThe package may also destroy the user's home directory.\n",
