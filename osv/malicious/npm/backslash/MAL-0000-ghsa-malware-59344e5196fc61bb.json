This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n### Original Description\nAny computer that has this package installed or running should be considered affected by a browser-based interceptor that hijacks network traffic and application APIs. The interceptor injects itself into functions related to web traffic and cryptocurrency wallets. The interceptor replaces values such as wallet addresses in transaction payloads and modifies the UI to hide its activity.",
