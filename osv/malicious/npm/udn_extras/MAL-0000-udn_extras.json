  "summary": "Malicious code in udn_extras package (npm)",
  "details": "The package is a malware because it contains a postinstall script that executes index.js. The index.js script gathers sensitive information such as hostname, platform, username, IP address, and environment variables and sends it to an external server (webhook.site) via an HTTPS POST request. This constitutes data exfiltration and is a clear indicator of malicious behavior.",
