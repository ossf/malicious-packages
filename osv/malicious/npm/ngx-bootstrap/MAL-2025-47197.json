It is considered suspicious because: The script appears to attempt to steal access tokens for npm, GitHub, AWS, GCP, etc. There is no changelog or new tags in the GitHub repository associated with these releases. The packages were uploaded by a service account: https://www.npmjs.com/~ngxbs\n\n---\n_-= Per source details.

All secrets and keys stored on that computer should be rotated immediately from a different computer. The package should be removed, but as full control of the computer may have been given to an outside entity, there is no guarantee that removing the package will remove all malicious software resulting from installing it.\n\n## Source: google-open-source-security (b39a50d6179dce1ee4e023cebcf88557e48d6060e10fd6c44db4b09abf2179bd)\nThis package was compromised by the Shai-Hulud NPM worm.
